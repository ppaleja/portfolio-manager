# Portfolio Manager
An app that allows you to track the growth of your stock portfolio.

## Why?
I started investing recently. What I realized however, is that I had investments on many different platforms, which unfortunately meant that it was difficult to chart my investment growth. So I wanted to make a simple tool to consolidate all my investments into, which can track the growth.

## Development Goals for version a1.0:
Finish setting up the API retrieval process.
Automate refreshing of ticker prices
Finish add, remove and edit tickers
